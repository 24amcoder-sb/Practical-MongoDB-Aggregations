# Practical MongoDB Aggregations

Code examples for the second half of the book _Practical MongoDB Aggregations_, published by Packt, and authored by Paul Done.

# What is this book about?
Officially endorsed by MongoDB, Inc., _Practical MongoDB Aggregations_ helps you unlock the full potential of the MongoDB aggregation framework, including the latest features of MongoDB 7.0. This book provides practical, easy-to-digest principles and approaches for increasing your effectiveness in developing aggregation pipelines, supported by examples for building pipelines to solve complex data manipulation and analytical tasks.

This book is customized for developers, architects, data analysts, data engineers, and data scientists with some familiarity with the aggregation framework. It begins by explaining the framework's architecture and then shows you how to build pipelines optimized for productivity and scale. 

Given  the critical role arrays play in MongoDB's document model, the book delves into best practices for optimally manipulating arrays. The latter part of the book equips you with examples to solve common data processing challenges so you can apply the lessons you've learned to practical situations.

# What you will learn
* Eliminate the performance penalties of processing data externally by filtering, grouping, and calculating aggregated values directly within the database
* Develop dynamic aggregation pipelines tailored to changing business requirements
* Master essential techniques to optimize aggregation pipelines for rapid data processing
* Achieve optimal efficiency for applying aggregations to vast datasets with effective sharding strategies
* Use pipelines to help you secure your data access and distribution

# Instructions
You can run each example as a MongoDB Shell script or as MongoDB for VS Code Playground script;

Example command line to run the first example via the MongoDB Shell as a script: 

```
mongosh --quiet "mongodb+srv://myuser:mypasswd@mycluster.abc123.mongodb.net/" examples/1-Foundational-Examples/1-filtered-top-subset.mongodb
```

Before running the command, note that you need to correct the username, password, and cluster domain name above to match your own environment.

# Practical MongoDB Aggregations

Code examples for the second half of the book Practical MongoDB Aggregations, published by Packt, and authored by Paul Done.

You can run each example as a MongoDB Shell script or as MongoDB for VScode Playground script;

Example command line to run the first example via the MongoDB Shell as a script: 

```
mongosh --quiet "mongodb+srv://myuser:mypasswd@mycluster.abc123.mongodb.net/" examples/1-Foundational-Examples/1-filtered-top-subset.mongodb
```

Before running the command, note that you need to correct the username, password, and cluster domain name above to match your own environment.
